# Chroma Control Native Components
This repository contains native components used as a part of Chroma Control as NuGet packages. They are not meant for direct consumption.

## Getting Started
The packages are available on [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages?q=ChromaControl.Native&includeComputedFrameworks=true&prerel=true&sortby=relevance) under the `ChromaControl.Native.*` namespace.

For direct consumption, use the `ChromaControl.SDK.*` packages instead available on [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages?q=ChromaControl.SDK&includeComputedFrameworks=true&prerel=true&sortby=relevance).

## Reporting security issues and bugs
