# Chroma Control Native Components
This repository contains native components used as a part of Chroma Control as NuGet packages. They are not meant for direct consumption.

The packages are available on [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages?q=ChromaControl.Native&includeComputedFrameworks=true&prerel=true&sortby=relevance) under the `ChromaControl.Native.*` namespace.

For direct consumption, use the `ChromaControl.Sdk.*` packages instead available on [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages?q=ChromaControl.Sdk&includeComputedFrameworks=true&prerel=true&sortby=relevance).
